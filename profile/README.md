## More Ways to Save on 1Lookup

Besides relying on bulk volume discounts, here are a few smart ways to save more on your reverse phone lookup costs:

### 1. Maximize Your Free Credits

Always run a small sample of your worst-performing lists through the 1,000 free lookups first. This lets you measure the exact ROI and bounce-rate reduction before spending a dime.

### 2. Combine Validation Steps

Because 1Lookup uses Universal Credits, you can clean your email lists, block risky IP addresses, and perform a reverse phone lookup all from the same prepaid balance without needing multiple expensive software subscriptions.

## What is a Reverse Phone Lookup?

A **reverse phone lookup** is the process of querying carrier databases or open-source intelligence to retrieve information associated with a phone number.

While consumer apps use this to find an individual's name, enterprise platforms like [1Lookup](https://www.1lookup.io/) perform a reverse phone lookup to validate the number's integrity. It tells businesses whether a number is currently active, what type of line it is (e.g., a risky disposable VoIP or a solid mobile line), who the carrier is, and whether it has a high spam or fraud risk score. By silently pinging telecom networks, this B2B reverse phone lookup lets companies clean their contact databases, block fraudulent signups in real time, and ensure they only call valid, reachable users.

If your business relies heavily on accurate data and fraud prevention, **1Lookup's enterprise-grade API is the smartest way to run a reverse phone lookup at scale.**
